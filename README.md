Hello everyone, My name is ROBIN KUMAR
  
It is my first Project using C & C++ . It is my first project (PRODUCT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM), which I have made in both C and C++ & I really enjoyed when I making this project,

In this program, we can add a product, view a product, delete a product, edit a product, and search a product. In this, I have used file handling, structure, switch case and

looping. I have made separate files for all functions(ADD, VIEW, DELETE, EDIT, SEARCH,HEADER FILES).I also have made a login page and it is my main file, and i also use 
 
colours functions and i have made a separate file , I have created the edit function in two ways, first with (Product ID) and (second with Product name).
